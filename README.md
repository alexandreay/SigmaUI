# Sigma-UI
SIGMA UI is a free open-source application based on the Elastic stack and Sigma Converter (sigmac). It simplifies development, use and sharing of Sigma, a generic rule format for SIEM systems. It is now possible to write, update and export Sigma rules straight from Kibana web UI for all supported Sigma backends including: Elastic stack, ArcSight, QRadar, Splunk, Qualys, Logpoint, Graylog and Windows Defender ATP. If youâ€™re using the Elastic stack for threat hunting purposes or as a primary SIEM, SIGMA UI has capabilities to drill-down directly from a rule to a search in Discover section of Kibana. Community Sigma rules are included with the application. Integration with Sigma official Github and SOC Prime TDM repositories in on the short-term roadmap.
